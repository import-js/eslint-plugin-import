# import/extensions - Ensure consistent use of file extension within the import path

Some file resolve algorithms allow you to omit the file extension within the import source path. For example the `node` resolver can resolve `./foo/bar` to the absolute path `/User/someone/foo/bar.js` because the `.js` extension is resolved automatically by default. Depending on the resolver you can configure more extensions to get resolved automatically.

In order to provide a consistent use of file extensions across your code base, this rule can enforce or disallow the use of certain file extensions.

## Rule Details

This rule either takes one string option, one object option, or a string and an object option. If it is the string `"never"` (the default value), then the rule forbids the use for any extension. If it is the string `"always"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements. If it is the string `"ignorePackages"`, then the rule enforces the use of extensions for all import statements except package imports.

```
"import/extensions": [<severity>, "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"]
```

By providing an object you can configure each extension separately.

```
"import/extensions": [<severity>, {
  <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages"
}]
```

 For example `{ "js": "always", "json": "never" }` would always enforce the use of the `.js` extension but never allow the use of the `.json` extension.

By providing both a string and an object, the string will set the default setting for all extensions, and the object can be used to set granular overrides for specific extensions.

```
"import/extensions": [
  <severity>,
  "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages",
  {
    <extension>: "never" | "always" | "ignorePackages" 
  }
]
```

For example, `["error", "never", { "svg": "always" }]` would require that all extensions are omitted, except for "svg".

### Exception

When disallowing the use of certain extensions this rule makes an exception and allows the use of extension when the file would not be resolvable without extension.

For example, given the following folder structure:

```
├── foo
│   ├── bar.js
│   ├── bar.json
```

and this import statement:

```js
import bar from './foo/bar.json';
```

then the extension can’t be omitted because it would then resolve to `./foo/bar.js`.

### Examples

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "never":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import express from 'express/index.js';
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "never":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

import express from 'express/index';

import * as path from 'path';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "always":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

import express from 'express';
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "always":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import express from 'express/index.js';

import * as path from 'path';
```

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to "ignorePackages":

```js
import foo from './foo';

import bar from './bar';

import Component from './Component';

```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to "ignorePackages":

```js
import foo from './foo.js';

import bar from './bar.json';

import Component from './Component.jsx';

import express from 'express';

```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to `['error', 'always', {ignorePackages: true} ]`:

```js
import Component from './Component.jsx';

import baz from 'foo/baz.js';

import express from 'express';

```
