# import/no-restricted-paths: Restrict which files can be imported in a given folder

Some projects contain files which are not always meant to be executed in the same environment.
For example consider a web application that contains specific code for the server and some specific code for the browser/client. In this case you don’t want to import server-only files in your client code.

In order to prevent such scenarios this rule allows you to define restricted zones where you can forbid files from imported if they match a specific path.

## Rule Details

This rule has one option. The option is an object containing the definition of all restricted `zones` and the optional `basePath` which is used to resolve relative paths within.
It may also specify an `allowedImportKinds`.
The default value for `basePath` is the current working directory and the default value for `allowedImportKinds` is an empty array.

Each zone consists of the `target` path and a `from` path. The `target` is the path where the restricted imports should be applied. The `from` path defines the folder that is not allowed to be used in an import. An optional `except` may be defined for a zone, allowing exception paths that would otherwise violate the related `from`. Note that `except` is relative to `from` and cannot backtrack to a parent directory. Additionally an override of `allowedImportKinds` can be given for each zone.
You may also specify an optional `message` for a zone, which will be displayed in case of the rule violation.

### Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```
my-project
├── client
│   └── foo.js
│   └── baz.js
└── server
    └── bar.js
```

and the current file being linted is `my-project/client/foo.js`.

The following patterns are considered problems when configuration set to `{ "zones": [ { "target": "./client", "from": "./server" } ] }`:

```js
import bar from '../server/bar';
```

The following patterns are not considered problems when configuration set to `{ "zones": [ { "target": "./client", "from": "./server" } ] }`:

```js
import baz from '../client/baz';
```

---------------

Given the following folder structure:

```
my-project
├── client
│   └── foo.js
│   └── baz.js
└── server
    ├── one
    │   └── a.js
    │   └── b.js
    └── two
```

and the current file being linted is `my-project/server/one/a.js`.

and the current configuration is set to:

```
{ "zones": [ {
    "target": "./tests/files/restricted-paths/server/one",
    "from": "./tests/files/restricted-paths/server",
    "except": ["./one"]
} ],
"allowedImportKinds": ["type"] }
```

The following pattern is considered a problem:

```js
import a from '../two/a'
```

The following patterns are not considered a problem:

```js
import b from './b'
```

```ts
import type T from '../two/a'
```
